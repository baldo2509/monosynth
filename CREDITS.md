* **Power Supply:** Based on the [_MFOS Wall Wart Supply_](http://musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth_new/WALLWARTSUPPLY/WALLWARTSUPPLY.php) by Ray Wilson;
* **Input Module:**
	- MIDI to CV conversion and Arpeggiator handled by microcontroller with custom code;
	- The Portamento/Glissato circuit is a simple buffered first-order RC lowpass filter;
* **VCOs:**	Cut-down version of the [_VCO-555_](https://electro-music.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=54623) design by Thomas Henry;
* **Sub-Oscillator:** From the article [_A study of Sub-Oscillators (and Oscillator Waveshaping)_](https://electricdruid.net/a-study-of-sub-oscillators/) from Electric Druid;

* **Mixers:** Commonly used Op-Amp inverting and non-inverting buffer and mixer circuit fragments;
* **VCF:** Based on the [_4621 - Voltage Controlled Filter_](http://www.modular.fonik.de/files/EFMforum/orgEFMfiles/efm-4600-doc_01.pdf#page=14)
  module by ELectronics For Music (EFM), which is itself based on the filters on early [Oberheim](https://oberheim.com) syntehsizers;
* **ADSR Envelope Generators:** Based on [_The Fastest Envelope in the West_][https://www.schmitzbits.de/adsr.html] schematic by René Shmitz,
  specifically on a version of this circuits with some small tweaks and additions, the [_ADSR-1_](https://www.skullandcircuits.com/adsr/?v=d3dcf429c679])
  module by Skull&Circuits;
* **Low Frequency Modulator:**
	- Square/Pulse wave and Triangle/Saw wave outputs generated by the [_Variable waveshape LFO_](https://kassu2000.blogspot.com/2015/10/variable-waveshape-lfo.html)
	  circuit by Kassutronics;
	- Noise generator and Sample/hold circuit based on info and schematics in the user manual to the [_EDU DIY Noise/S&H_](https://www.ericasynths.lv/media/SH_MANUAL_v1.pdf)
	  module, by Erica Synths and Moritz Klein; trigger processing circuit based on the [_Level shifter for S&H_](https://www.schmitzbits.de/sah.html) schematic by René Shmitz.
* **Distortion:** Designed based on reverse engineered schematics for the [_ProCo RAT_](https://www.electrosmash.com/proco-rat) guitar effects pedal by ElectroSmash.com, adapted
	for use with a bipolar power supply and modular synthesizer signal levels;

* **Chorus:** Based on [_The Florist_](https://www.madbeanpedals.com/projects/_folders/FilterMod/pdf/Florist.pdf) guitar effects pedal schematic by MadBeanPedals,
    adapted for use with modular synth signal levels and to provide a stereo output;
* **Stereo Delay:** Based on [_The Sea Urchin_](https://www.madbeanpedals.com/EP/downloads/delay/SeaUrchin2019.zip) and [_Degenerator_](https://www.madbeanpedals.com/projects/_folders/Delay/docs/Degenerator.zip)
	schematics by MadBeanPedals, adapted for use with modular synth signal level;
